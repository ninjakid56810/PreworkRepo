## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The biggest challenge i encountered while building the app was simply being able to navigate through
XCodes interface. I am most comfortable coding in Java using Eclipse on Windows, and this was my first time
using XCode, coding in Swift, and also my first time using a Mac. It was tedious not knowing shortcuts
and generally being able to use macOS efficiently. I've also only ever used GitHub for storing my own
personal projects and categorizing my homework so I can save everything, and I was introduced to this brilliant
idea of pushing and committing.
